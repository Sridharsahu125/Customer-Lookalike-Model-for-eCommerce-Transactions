Customer Lookalike Model for eCommerce Transactions:

This project creates a Customer Lookalike Model that identifies similar customers based on transaction and demographic data. The goal is to help businesses target high-potential customers with personalized offers.

Overview:

The model segments customers based on their transaction behavior and creates lookalikes (similar customers). By using similarity scores, businesses can find customers with the same purchasing patterns as their best-performing customers.

Datasets:
Customers.csv

Customer details: CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, SignupDate
Transactions.csv

Transaction details: TransactionID, CustomerID, TransactionAmount, TransactionDate, ProductCategory
Products.csv

Product details: ProductID, Category, Price
Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Merge Customers.csv and Transactions.csv using CustomerID.

Aggregate transaction data (Total Revenue, Transactions Count, Avg Basket Size).

Handle missing data and ensure consistency.

Feature Engineering:

Create features like TotalRevenue, TotalTransactions, AvgBasketSize, and TenureDays.
Normalization:

Scale the numerical features for uniformity.
Lookalike Model:

Compute cosine similarity scores between customers.
Find the top 3 lookalikes for each customer based on similarity.
Output:

Generate Lookalike.csv containing the top 3 lookalikes and similarity scores for each customer.

Key Insights

Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on behavior to target them more effectively.

Targeted Marketing: Focus on customers similar to the high-value ones for improved ROI.
